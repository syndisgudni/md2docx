| **Impact**            | Things are very not ok. As a result, an adversary can do stuff that is bad. |

### Technical Details

hahah test Stuff and things are bad and therefore not good. It cannot be stressed enough how not ok this is. Figure 1.1 illustrates how bad this is.

**TODO** Add some *things*!

Another paragraph is required to explain all the bad things an adversary could do with this vulnerability.

### Recommendation

Change the thing that is not ok so that it is ok instead.
