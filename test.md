| **Issue Identifier**  | `SYN-XX-Y-Z` |
| **Impact**            | Things are very not ok. As a result, an adversary can do stuff that is bad. Here is some more text to ensure a multiline impact description. Move along, just rest assured knowing that things are bad and you should feel bad. |

### Technical Details

Stuff and things are bad and therefore not good. It cannot be stressed enough how not ok this is. Figure 1.1 illustrates how bad this is.

Here is a **TODO** list with ***some* things** of those *items* that have yet to be `done` for this project.
* Add some `code` ***stuff*** and *things*!
* Also, put imgs and code blocks in figures.

Why not? Here's another list but with numbers:
1. The quick brown fox
2. The lazy dog
3. Jumping over thereof

```python
import stuff

# comment

thing = stuff.things()

print(thing)
print("lol")
```

Another paragraph is required to explain all the bad things an adversary could do with this vulnerability. Also, [here](https://syndis.is) is a link to the [syndis.is](https://syndis.is) website.

### Recommendation

Change the thing that is not ok so that it is ok instead.
